## Assignment info

The requirements for the **week 6 assignment** were done and returned in time _(parts 1 & 2)_.

This repository might receive more updates in the future _(past the deadline)_, since I will most likely continue working with this repo and implement further exercises and tasks _(parts 3 & 4)_.

Further edit: **Week 7 assignment** builds up on the previous one. Thus, this repo will be used and updated accordingly. All crucial changes and edits were done and returned in time.

## About the project
